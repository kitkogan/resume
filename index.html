	<p>
	  I am currently enrolled in the JavaScript FullStack TechDegree program provided by Treehouse. 
	  I am at the beginning of my software engineering career but I have already been challenged and 
	  excited by the projects and workshops I’ve completed in this course. Aside from JavaScript itself 
	  I have also become familiar with using GitHub, text editors such as VS Code, HTML, CSS, ES2015, 
	  and other related developer tools and concepts. My knowledge and skillset are expanding on a daily 
	  basis and I’m already thinking ahead to the myriad other coding languages and opportunities for growth
	  and learning in my future.

    <p>In my free time I enjoy programming digital and analogue synthesizers and step sequencers, and finding new and creative ways to get them to communicate with other various electronic instruments (and each other!) I also enjoy DJing and seeing live music, all        manner of arts/crafts, reading technical manuals, being in nature, and spending time with my partner and our two cats.</p>
